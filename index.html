            <p>We at Examor are working on a global initiative that we hope will bring design thinking methodologies into practice for the Kingdom of God. We are based in Bangkok, Thailand with feet on the ground in Australia and the United States and are currently consulting with organizations in Vietnam, California and Oklahoma. <strong>Our goal to provide you with a mirror and a telescope</strong>. We aim to help you understand your current state and the constraints of the realities you face. Then we help you to see into the future of what you can become by creating out of love.</p>
